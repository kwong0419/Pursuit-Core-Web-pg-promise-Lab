# Pursuit-Core-Web-pg-promise-Lab

​
Continuing the starter project [here](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-pg-promise-Intro/tree/master), add the following features:
​

## 1. Posts

​

### Backend

​
Complete the `posts.js` file adding implementations for the following routes
​

- /posts/all
- /posts/:user_id
- /posts/register
  ​

### Frontend

​
Add UI elements to:
​

- Display all posts
- Display all posts from a given user
- Create a new post
  ​

## 2. Likes

​
Add a new table `likes` that represents a user liking a post. It should have the structure below:
​

- Likes
  - `id`: integer, **primary key**
  - `liker_id`: integer, **foreign key** referencing the column `id` in Users
  - `post_id`: integer, **foreign key** referencing the column `id` in Posts.
    ​
    Seed the database with likes.
    ​
    Then, add the following functionality:
    ​
- Display the number of likes of each post
- Display users who have liked each post
- Filter posts by the number of likes (e.g show only posts with 5+ likes)
